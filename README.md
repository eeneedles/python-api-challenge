# python-api-challenge

This is a repository using Python requests and APIs to answer weather related questions and problems.  The deliverables are in two parts.  The first part (WeatherPy) uses cityPy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to answer the question "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" and the second part (VacationPy) creates representative models of weather across cities to identify ideal vacation spots based on chosen weather parameters and identify the hotels closest to those cities using the Geoapify API.


The repository contains a README file, a gitignore for the API keys, a CSV file called cities.csv containing the city weather data (coordinates, maximum temperatures, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed) and a folder called WeatherPy containing two Jupyter Notebook files called VacationPy and WeatherPy containing the code, and a Python file that stores the API keys used to create the city data used for the plots in VacationPy and Weather Py.
